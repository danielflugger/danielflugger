      <p>IDist ® is a global design and procurement platform for physical asset management infrastructure — the system that tracks, validates, and coordinates the lifecycle of distributed physical assets across international operations. Built to replace fragmented spreadsheet-and-email workflows with a unified, auditable pipeline from asset specification through procurement, deployment, and verification.</p>
      <p>The platform serves organizations managing large physical asset portfolios across multiple countries and regulatory environments, where procurement errors cascade into six-figure cost overruns and compliance failures compound across jurisdictions.</p>

      <h2 class="cs-section-title">Asset management across borders, without a single system of record.</h2>
      <div class="cs-body">
        <p>Managing physical asset portfolios across four countries means four regulatory frameworks, four procurement standards, four ways of tracking what exists and what doesn't — and no shared infrastructure connecting any of them. The client was running their global asset operations on a patchwork of spreadsheets, email chains, and disconnected legacy platforms that had accreted over years of regional expansion.</p>
        <p>The consequences were predictable: procurement errors that weren't caught until assets arrived on-site, compliance documents that referenced specifications no longer in service, and no way to answer a basic question — "what is the current deployment status of this asset class across all our markets" — without a multi-day data gathering exercise.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-eyebrow">02 — Research &amp; Approach</div>
      <h2 class="cs-section-title">Normalize before you build. Then automate the hard parts.</h2>
      <div class="cs-body">
        <p>The first and most important decision was to spend significant architecture time on the data model before writing application code. International asset management requires a canonical data model that normalizes specifications across different national standards — without that foundation, every automation layer built on top creates new inconsistencies.</p>
        <p>The canonical model aligned asset specifications to ISO 55000 (the international asset management standard), with jurisdiction-specific extension fields for each market's regulatory requirements. This meant that a single asset specification could be used to generate the correct procurement documents for any market the client operated in.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed a unified asset data model aligned to ISO 55000, with per-jurisdiction extension schemas for regulatory fields</li>
          <li>Built a vendor compliance scoring engine that validates suppliers against the specific requirements of each jurisdiction before allowing them into a procurement workflow</li>
          <li>Implemented real-time procurement tracking with automated milestone verification — each stage of the procurement process has defined completion criteria that must be met before the workflow advances</li>
          <li>Created a specification matching engine using structured comparison against validated asset catalogs, flagging mismatches before orders are placed rather than after assets arrive</li>
          <li>Designed an automated document processing pipeline that ingests vendor submissions (invoices, certifications, spec sheets) and validates them against the expected format and content for each procurement stage</li>

      <div class="cs-takeaways">
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Normalize Before You Optimize"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">International asset management requires a canonical data model before any automation adds value. We spent approximately 40% of architecture time on the data model — defining the canonical asset schema, the jurisdiction extension pattern, and the identifier strategy — before writing a single line of application code. That investment paid back at least 10x in reduced edge cases, reduced integration complexity, and reduced bug surface during implementation.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Compliance Is a Feature, Not a Constraint"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">Building jurisdiction-aware validation into the core pipeline — not as an afterthought layer added after the core system was built — eliminated the most expensive failure mode: non-compliant procurement that requires physical rework after assets are already in the field. When compliance is structural, it's impossible to skip. When it's a wrapper, it gets bypassed under pressure.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Enterprise Trust Requires Audit Trails"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">Every state change, every approval, and every specification match is logged with full provenance — who did what, when, and why. This wasn't a compliance checkbox. It was the specific feature that got procurement directors to actually migrate off spreadsheets. The first question every enterprise stakeholder asks is: "if something goes wrong, can I see exactly what happened and who was responsible?" The answer had to be yes before anyone was willing to rely on the system for decisions that affected real money.</div>
