    <div class="cs-overview">
      <p>NYCID is a private property intelligence platform that generates comprehensive dossiers for New York City residential properties — fusing municipal open data, building records, environmental assessments, and market signals into a single verified record per property. Built for real estate operators, investors, and underwriters who need depth beyond what any listing platform provides.</p>
      <p>New York City publishes extraordinary amounts of property data across dozens of disconnected agencies — DOB permits, DOF assessments, HPD violations, DEP environmental records, ACRIS ownership transfers, DCP zoning — but no system unifies them into a coherent property-level view. NYCID does.</p>

      <h2 class="cs-section-title">12 agencies publishing data about the same properties in 12 different formats.</h2>
      <div class="cs-body">
        <p>New York City is the most data-rich property market in the world. The Departments of Buildings, Finance, Housing Preservation and Development, Environmental Protection, City Planning, and the ACRIS system collectively publish more data about more properties than any other municipality on earth. The problem is that each agency designed its data independently, uses different property identifiers, formats addresses differently, and publishes at different cadences with different schemas.</p>
        <p>Existing platforms — StreetEasy, PropertyShark, CoStar — provide listing and transaction data, but not deep operational intelligence: permit history, violation patterns, environmental flags, assessment trends, ownership chain, zoning constraints. Assembling that intelligence for a single property manually takes hours across a dozen different government portals. For a portfolio of properties, it's impractical at any useful scale.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-eyebrow">02 — Research &amp; Approach</div>
      <h2 class="cs-section-title">BBL as the universal join key. Fuzzy matching as the fallback.</h2>
      <div class="cs-body">
        <p>The first architectural decision — and the one that made everything else possible — was to use the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) identifier as the universal join key across all data sources. The BBL is the one identifier that NYC property law requires to be consistent across agencies, because it's how the tax system tracks ownership. Every other identifier (address, building ID, parcel number) varies by agency. BBL doesn't.</p>
        <p>The problem is that not every dataset has BBL, and some datasets have it wrong. For those cases, a fuzzy address matching fallback chain resolves ambiguous references to probable BBL candidates, which are then verified through geocoding. This two-path identity resolution strategy handles the full range of data quality across the 12+ sources while maintaining a 97% overall match rate.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>BBL-based canonical identity — every record in every source is resolved to a BBL before entering the registry. Records that can't be matched are held in a review queue with confidence scores, not silently dropped.</li>
          <li>Fuzzy address matching fallback using Jaro-Winkler similarity with token normalization, followed by geocode verification to confirm candidate BBL assignments</li>
          <li>Multi-source ingestion pipeline normalizes schemas from each agency into the canonical data model — handling NYC Open Data APIs (Socrata), ACRIS bulk files, and DOB NOW API independently</li>
          <li>Change detection system: when any source updates a record, the affected dossier is flagged for regeneration. Every change is logged with full audit trail — what changed, from which source, at what time</li>
          <li>Edge case handling for condos, co-ops, and tax lot splits (approximately 15% of the dataset) — each gets correct BBL assignment and appropriate data inheritance rules from parent lots</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="cs-section-title">GCP-native property registry at NYC scale.</h2>
      <div class="cs-body">
        <p>The architecture is designed for both scale and freshness — the 8.1M property registry needs to stay current as agencies publish updates, and individual dossier requests need to resolve in under 3 seconds. These two requirements drove the key architectural decisions: BigQuery for the registry (batch-optimized, analytical), Firestore for user state and saved dossiers (real-time, query-optimized), and Cloud Run for the dossier generation engine (stateless, scalable).</p>

      <h2 class="cs-section-title">What building with municipal data at scale actually teaches you.</h2>
      <div class="cs-takeaways">
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Identity Resolution Is the Hardest Problem"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">Joining data across NYC agencies sounds straightforward until you encounter the full reality: every agency formats addresses differently, some use BBL and some don't, and edge cases (condo units, co-op shares, tax lots that split across the dataset) are not rare — they're approximately 15% of the full dataset. The identity resolution layer took longer to build than every other component combined, and it's what determines whether the rest of the system is trustworthy. A fast dossier generated from a wrong join is worse than no dossier at all.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Temporal History Is the Moat"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">A snapshot of current property data is useful. A temporal record showing permit filings over 10 years, violation patterns across ownership changes, assessment trends before and after major renovations, and full chain of ownership transforms a data product into an intelligence product. We stored every version of every record from every source — not just the latest. That decision doubles the storage cost and significantly complicates ingestion, but it's what separates the platform from a scraper. Retroactive temporal history cannot be manufactured. It has to be accumulated.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-takeaway">
          <div class="cs-takeaway-title">"Municipal Data Is Messy But Rich"</div>
          <div class="cs-takeaway-body">NYC publishes more property data than any city in the world. The challenge is not access — most of it is free through NYC Open Data. The challenge is normalization and trust. Building confidence scores for each data source, displaying provenance on every field (which source, which publication date), and making it easy for users to trace any data point back to its original government record was the difference between a prototype that engineers found interesting and a product that real estate professionals rely on for decisions involving real money.</div>
