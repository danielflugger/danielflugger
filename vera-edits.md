# VERA.HTML — Four Targeted Edits

## EDIT 1: Add pull-quote bridge to essay (after "Why this exists" section)

Find the section that says:
"The Proof Economy described why verification infrastructure matters. VERA is the how"

RIGHT AFTER that paragraph, add a new blockquote/callout element:

```
"You do not build the proof layer to protect something you have stopped caring about. You build it, and in the building, you remember why you cared in the first place."

— from The Proof Economy, the thesis behind VERA. [Read it →](the-proof-economy.html)
```

Style it as a prominent pull-quote with left border accent, slightly larger italic text. This is the emotional hook that makes visitors want to read the full 10,000-word essay.

## EDIT 2: Add Influencer Inversion to "Creator with a Real Body of Work" persona

Find the Creator persona card section. After the existing bullet points, add one more bullet:

```
• VERA is the infrastructure for what The Proof Economy calls the Influencer Inversion — the shift from performing for algorithms to letting your verified work speak for itself
```

## EDIT 3: Strengthen "Core Insight" section with Motivation Collapse

Find the "Build the moat as you go" section. After the paragraph that says "VERA gives you a private-first methodology: structure first, share on your terms."

Add this new paragraph BEFORE the paragraph about "people doing this instinctively":

```
The deepest risk is not that someone copies your work. It is that you stop caring enough to protect it. When AI can approximate what you do, the motivation to document, to verify, to invest in quality has to be actively maintained. That motivation does not survive on its own. It survives when you build the infrastructure that makes your specific judgment visible and valuable. VERA is the practice that maintains it.
```

## EDIT 4: Replace bottom pull-quote with stronger line

Find:
"The people who create real value should be the people who capture it. VERA is how you build the infrastructure to make that true — privately, methodically, and on your own terms."

Replace with:
"The flywheel needs a human at the center who still gives a damn. VERA is how you become that human — with infrastructure that proves your judgment matters, privately and on your own terms."
